#### Inference Features
- Added Prompt Amplifier to Inference - click the magic wand ü™Ñ in the prompt editor to expand and enrich your ideas. Tailor the vibe with the ‚ÄòFeel‚Äô selector and watch as your generations come to life with extra detail, coherence, and flair!
- Added support for HiDream in Inference - see [ComfyUI Examples](https://comfyanonymous.github.io/ComfyUI_examples/hidream/) for more details
- Added toggle for filtering Inference Extra Networks by base model

- Added hotkey (`Ctrl+Up`/`Ctrl+Down`) in Inference prompt editors to adjust the weight emphasis of the token under the caret or the currently selected text.
  - This automatically wraps the token/selection in parentheses `()` if it's not already weighted.

  - Packages can now use the `SharedFolderLayout` property to define a `ConfigFileType` and `ConfigSharingOptions` (like `RootKey`), without needing to implement custom configuration logic.

### Changed
#### Inference Features
- Improved the quality of Inference inpainting by upgrading the workflow behind the scenes. The workflow remains the same for you ‚Äî just better results!

#### Internal / Developer Changes
- (Internal) Upgraded FluentAvalonia to 2.3.0

- Fixed errors from invalid pip specifiers in requirements files
#### User Interface & Experience (UI/UX)
- Fixed Image Viewer animation loader keeping file handles open, which resolves 2 different issues (OSes are fun):
  - (macOS) Fixed `FileNotFoundException` crash when navigating to Inference tab after deleting a Webp animation file previously opened in the Image Viewer Dialog.
  - (Windows) Fixed Webp animation files unable to be deleted without closing the app first.
- Fixed Image Viewer `FileNotFoundException` on fetching image size, if navigating to a deleted image file.
- (macOS) Fixed Webp / Gif animations RGB colors flipped.
